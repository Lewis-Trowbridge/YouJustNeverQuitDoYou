# YouJustNeverQuitDoYou
An awful idea that only someone as oddly persistent as myself could make.

## What is this?
In the game Destiny 2, there is a character called Hawthorne, a Lightless human who runs the clan system in game. Since the game has come out, when completing
the weekly Clan XP challenge, she will say the exact same set of lines. Destiny 2 released 3 years ago. Needless to say, this has become rather grating, but has also
become an inside joke between me and my friends. Hence, this now exists.
